About
This repository provides a pipeline for missing data imputation quality evaluation:

Background:
Depression remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, robust clinical studies is necessary to assess treatment responses. Many studies provide a significant data source for understanding treatment effectiveness. 
However, missing data poses a substantial challenge in extracting reliable insights. This research aims to use TDA approach to assess and improve the quality of missing data imputation, which is pivotal in ensuring the integrity of clinical study analyses.

Software:
Our pipeline is written in Python 3 and builds on several open source packages, including sklearn_tda, statmapper, sklearn.cluster, sklearn.manifold and network.

The pipeline expects an input dataset in CSV format.
